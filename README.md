# Blazing fast GitHub Pages deploy

> ðŸ”¥ The most blazingest action to deploy your GitHub pages website


## Why did you make another action to deploy to GitHub pages?

This GitHub action uses JavaScript for maximum speed ðŸš€.
> Using a [JavaScript action](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-actions#javascript-actions) simplifies the action code and executes faster than a Docker container action. 

No secrets needed. You only need to configure a workflow file.


## Usage

1. Create a new workflow by adding `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to your project.
2. Adjust the [workflow options](#workflow-options) for your project

Here is an example `deploy.yml` file:

```yml
name: Blazing fast GitHub Pages deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
    - master

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@master
      - name: npm install, test and build
        run: |
          npm install
          npm run test
          npm run build
      - name: Deploy site to gh-pages branch
        uses: alex-page/blazing-fast-gh-pages-deploy@v1.0.0
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```
